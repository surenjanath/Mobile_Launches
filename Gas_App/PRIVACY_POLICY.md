- Supabase row-level security to restrict access per user
- Device-level encryption is recommended (PIN, biometrics)

Despite safeguards, no system is 100% secure. Use strong device security and keep backups.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Policy as the App evolves. When we do:

- Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.
