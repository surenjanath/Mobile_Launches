**Last Updated:** January 15, 2025  
**Effective Date:** January 15, 2025

## Agreement to Terms
By downloading, installing, or using the Gas Tracker mobile application (“App”), you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree, do not install or use the App.

## Description of Service
Gas Tracker helps drivers log fuel expenses, manage payments, track multiple vehicles, monitor maintenance, and generate analytics. The App is provided for informational and record-keeping purposes only and does not guarantee accuracy of mileage, pricing, or financial outcomes.

## Eligibility
You must be at least 13 years old (or the age of digital consent in your jurisdiction) to use the App. By using Gas Tracker, you represent that you meet this requirement and have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.

## Accounts & Security
- You may optionally authenticate to enable cloud sync. Keep your credentials secure.
- You are responsible for all actions taken using your account or device.
- Notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorized access.

## Acceptable Use
You agree not to:
- Use the App for unlawful, deceptive, or fraudulent purposes.
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems, APIs, or data.
- Upload malicious code, automated scripts, or spam content.
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or exploit the App outside of permitted APIs.
- Use the App while driving or in any way that distracts from safe vehicle operation.

## Data & Content
- You retain ownership of the data you upload (fuel logs, vehicle info, etc.).
- By using the App, you grant us a limited license to store, process, and back up your data solely to provide the service.
- We may collect aggregated, anonymized statistics to improve the App.
- See the [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for details on collection and use.

## Intellectual Property
- The App, codebase, logos, and documentation belong to Surenjanath Singh.
- You may not copy, distribute, modify, or create derivative works without permission.
- You may not remove proprietary notices or trademarks from the App.

## Third-Party Services
Gas Tracker integrates with Expo, Supabase, and mobile OS services. Your use of those services is subject to their respective terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third-party outages or policy changes.

## Service Availability & Changes
- The App is provided “as is” and “as available.” Features may change at any time.
- We reserve the right to suspend or discontinue the App, or any feature, without liability.
- Planned maintenance or unexpected outages may limit availability.

## Disclaimer of Warranties
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND AVAILABILITY. GAS TRACKER DOES NOT PROVIDE TAX, LEGAL, OR FINANCIAL ADVICE. ALL OUTPUTS ARE FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

## Limitation of Liability
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW:
- WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR DATA.
- OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATED TO THE APP SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID (IF ANY) FOR ACCESS TO GAS TRACKER DURING THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM.
- YOU ASSUME ALL RISK FROM USING THE APP, INCLUDING DRIVING DECISIONS, MAINTENANCE SCHEDULING, OR FINANCIAL ACTIONS BASED ON APP OUTPUTS.

## Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Surenjanath Singh and affiliates from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of the App, your data, or your violation of these Terms or applicable law.

## Updates to Terms
We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via in-app notice or email (if provided). Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## Termination
- You may stop using the App and delete your data at any time.
- We may suspend or terminate access immediately if you violate these Terms, engage in fraudulent/abusive behavior, or if required by law.
- Upon termination, your right to use the App ceases, but provisions that should survive (e.g., intellectual property, disclaimers, liability limits) will remain in effect.

## Governing Law & Dispute Resolution
These Terms are governed by the laws of Trinidad and Tobago (or the developer’s principal place of business) without regard to conflict-of-law rules. We encourage informal dispute resolution first. If unresolved, disputes will be submitted to the competent courts of that jurisdiction, unless applicable law requires otherwise. You waive participation in class actions to the extent allowed by law.

## Severability
If any provision is found unenforceable, it will be limited to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining Terms will remain in full force.

## Entire Agreement
These Terms and the Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the App and supersede previous agreements or understandings.
